    description="In the realm of verbal communication, most common non-clinical speech disfluencies are filler words and filled pauses, which pose challenges for effective oral presentations. Yet their detection is no easy task. This article presents the usage of OpenAIâ€™s Whisper for filled pauses and filler words detection in Spanish oral presentations, including on-the-wild usage with undergraduate students. Preliminary results indicate that Whisper demonstrates promise as a valuable tool to identify a substantial amount of filler words and filled pauses. Despite areas of improvement, Whisper serves as a diagnostic tool for assessing disfluences in oral communication."
